    tokio-console [OPTIONS] [TARGET_ADDR] [SUBCOMMAND]

ARGS:
    <TARGET_ADDR>
            The address of a console-enabled process to connect to.
            
            This may be an IP address and port, or a DNS name.
            
            On Unix platforms, this may also be a URI with the `file` scheme that specifies the path
            to a Unix domain socket, as in `file://localhost/path/to/socket`.
            
            [default: http://127.0.0.1:6669]

        --colorterm <truecolor>
            Overrides the value of the `COLORTERM` environment variable.
            
            If this is set to `24bit` or `truecolor`, 24-bit RGB color support will be enabled.

        --log <ENV_FILTER>
            Log level filter for the console's internal diagnostics.
            
            Logs are written to a new file at the path given by the `--log-dir` argument (or its
            default value), or to the system journal if `systemd-journald` support is enabled.
            
            If this is set to 'off' or is not set, no logs will be written.
            
            [default: off]
            
            [env: RUST_LOG=]

        --log-dir <LOG_DIRECTORY>

        --retain-for <RETAIN_FOR>
            How long to continue displaying completed tasks and dropped resources after they have
            been closed.
            
            This accepts either a duration, parsed as a combination of time spans (such as `5days
            2min 2s`), or `none` to disable removing completed tasks and dropped resources.
            
            Each time span is an integer number followed by a suffix. Supported suffixes are:
            
            * `nsec`, `ns` -- nanoseconds
            
            * `usec`, `us` -- microseconds
            
            * `msec`, `ms` -- milliseconds
            
            * `seconds`, `second`, `sec`, `s`
            
            * `minutes`, `minute`, `min`, `m`
            
            * `hours`, `hour`, `hr`, `h`

            * `weeks`, `week`, `w`
            
            * `months`, `month`, `M` -- defined as 30.44 days
            
            * `years`, `year`, `y` -- defined as 365.25 days
            
            [default: 6s]
