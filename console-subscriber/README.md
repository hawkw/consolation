## Overview

[`tokio-console`] is a debugging and profiling tool for asynchronous Rust
applications, which collects and displays in-depth diagnostic data on the
asynchronous tasks, resources, and operations in an application. The console
system consists of two primary components:

* _instrumentation_, embedded in the application, which collects data from the
  async runtime and exposes it over the console's [wire format]
* _consumers_, such as the [`tokio-console`] command-line application, which
  connect to the instrumented application, recieve telemetry data, and display
  it to the user

This crate implements the instrumentation-side interface using data
emitted by the async runtime using the [`tracing`]. It provides a type
implementing the [`Layer`] trait from [`tracing-subscriber`], for collecting and
aggregating the runtime's [`tracing`] data, and a gRPC server that exports
telemetry to clients.

[wire format]: https://crates.io/crates/console-api

## Getting Started

To instrument your asynchronous application, you must be using an async runtime
that supports the [`tracing`] instrumentation required by the console.
Currently, the only runtime that implements this instrumentation is [Tokio]
version 1.7.0 and newer.

### Enabling Tokio Instrumentation

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Currently, the [`tracing`] support in the [`tokio`
runtime][Tokio] is considered *experimental*. In order to use
`console-subscriber` with Tokio, the following is required:

* Tokio's optional `tracing` dependency must be enabled. For example:
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  # ...
  tokio = { version = "1.15", features = ["full", "tracing"] }
  ```

* The `tokio_unstable` cfg flag, which enables experimental APIs in Tokio, must
  be enabled. It can be enabled by setting the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable
  at build-time:
  ```shell
  $ RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo build
  ```
  or, by adding the following to the `.cargo/config` file in a Cargo workspace:
  ```toml
  [build]
  rustflags = ["--cfg", "tokio_unstable"]
  ```
### Adding the Console Subscriber

If the runtime emits compatible `tracing` events, enabling the console is as
simple as adding the following line to your `main` function:

```rust
console_subscriber::init();
```

This sets the [default `tracing` subscriber][default] to serve console telemetry
(as well as logging to stdout based on the `RUST_LOG` environment variable). The
console subscriber's behavior can be configured via a set of
[environment variables][env].

For programmatic configuration, a [builder interface][builder] is also provided:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

console_subscriber::ConsoleLayer::builder()
    // set how long the console will retain data from completed tasks
    .retention(Duration::from_secs(60))
    // set the address the server is bound to
    .server_addr(([127, 0, 0, 1], 5555))
    // ... other configurations ...
    .init();
```

The layer provided by this crate can also be combined with other [`Layer`]s from
other crates:

```rust
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

// spawn the console server in the background,
// returning a `Layer`:
let console_layer = console_subscriber::spawn();

// build a `Subscriber` by combining layers with a
// `tracing_subscriber::Registry`:
tracing_subscriber::registry()
    // add the console layer to the subscriber
    .with(console_layer)
    // add other layers...
    .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
 // .with(...)
    .init();
```

### Crate Feature Flags

This crate provides the following feature flags and optional dependencies:

* [`parking_lot`]: Use the [`parking_lot`] crate's locks, rather than `std::sync`.
  Using [`parking_lot`] may result in improved performance, especially in highly
  concurrent applications. Disabled by default.
